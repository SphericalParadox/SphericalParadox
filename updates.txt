1761086977 /-/ Hello Highlands! /-/ We thank you for your patience due to storm delays, but... We are proud to announce that Inverness Bus Station will be refurbished for the new year. We currently aim to have it open on January 2nd (as we do not run service on New Years).\nznIs your service affected?\n> All our Highlands services that serve Inverness will be affected. During the works we have chosen to terminate at Queensgate and Union Street (limited). At peak hours, some services may terminate in Longman near the Justice Centre.\n\nI will miss my connection!\n> We apologize for any inconvenience caused during these works, however as per our current guide, you should plan 10-15 minutes between connections to help during traffic conditions. As it stands, you should be able to do the walk between Longman and Queensgate if your service is terminated at Longman. However, we realise for some customers the walk is hard due to mobility issues. If this affects you, when you leave your bus please seek one of our assistance team at Longman or Queensgate, and they will assist you to the bus you need.*\n\nWhat will this bring?\n> The new bus station will be fully enclosed once you enter the building, and will have improved safety measures such as modern CCTV and stand doors. We also are partnering with MCM and our colleagues at SE/SGM to bring the cutting edge of information technology, this will bring brand new next bus information and general station info direct to you at the stands. As part of this, we are also renaming the Stances to Stands, to make it clearer for all audiences.\n\n* Buses may be delayed up to 5 minutes to assist you, if we cannot transport you in time you will be offered a ride in an assistance vehicle to your house, or a seat on the next bus free of charge (or £1 compensation) /-/ Highlands
